For this lecture we are going to refer to the code sample which can be found 
int the java code Examples EnumTest.java



Enums are a way to assign ordinal values to types that have a selected number of outcomes.  

  Examples include Months (Jan,Feb,Mar, ...) , 
  Days of the week (Monday,Tuesday,...) , 
  Levels (Simmer,Low,Medium,High) etc.  


Enums make code safer and easier to read and the Java enum type automatically creates a number 
of built in conviences by including the following methods:

   name()
   toString()
   ordinal()
   compareTo()

and static functions

   values()
   valueOf()

  In this lecture we are going to go over an example of enum using Months which in the 
  the previously mentioned link.
