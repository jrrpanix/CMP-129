Inheritance

----------------------------------------------------------------


Inheritance - allows a new class to extend an existing class.
              the new class automatically gets all of the members of
              the class it extends.


For example from our previous lectures we created a 
Rectangle, Triangle and Circle classes.  Suppose we create
a super class called Shape and then have each of these
classes inherit from Shape and let.s say for each shape
created we want to give it an id.



   public class Shape { // This is the SuperClass
       public int id;

       public double area() {
          return -987654321.0; // Not implemented
       }
    }


   public class Rectangle extends Shape {  // This is a subclass of Shape

       private double len_;
       private double width_;

       public Rectangle( double len , double width ) {
          len_=len;
          width_=width;
       }

       public double area() {
          return len_ * width_;
       }

       public double getLength() {
          return len_;
       }

       public double getWidth() {
          return width_;
       }

   }

   public class Circle extends Shape { // This is a subclass of Shape
       private double radius_;

       public Circle( double radius ) {
          radius_ = radius;
       }

       public double area() {
          return Math.PI * radius_ * radius_;
       }

       public double getRadius() {
          return radius_;
       }
   }

------------------------------------------------
The advantage of using the "Super" class Shape
-------------------------------------------------

Suppose we are given a 1000 different types of shapes and
watned to calculate the area of the shapes the if we 
have the concept of a shape we can do this

   public double totalArea( Shape [] shapes ) {
     double total = 0;
     for( Shape s : shapes ) total += s.area();
     return total;
   }


if we didn't have this Super class then we would have to do this ...

   public double totalArea( Object [] objects ) {
     double total = 0;
     for( Object o : objects ) {
        if ( o.getClass() == Circle.Class ) {
	     total += ((Cirlce)o).area();
        }
        else if ( o.getClass() == Rectangle.Class ) {
	          total += ((Rectangle)o).area();
	}
     }
   }


-------------------------------------------------
Note the subclass inherits from the super class but the 
superclass does not inherit from the subclass
-------------------------------------------------

So Shape does not know about Rectangle's len_ or witdh_
Nor does shape know about Circle.s radius_

But Rectangle and Circle inherit the member id from Shape   

------------------------------------------------------------
Lecture 09
Inheritance continued
Follows Gaddis Chapter 10
------------------------------------------------------------

In the previous lecture we introduce the concept of Inheritence using the example of a 
Shape as the Super Class and Rectangle and Circle as SubClasses.  In object oriented programming 
terminology the Super class is also referred to as the Base Class and the SubClass is also 
referred to as the Derived Class.

Our code outline was as follows

   public class Shape {
       public double area() { return 0; }
    }


   public class Rectangle extends Shape {  

    }                                                }

   public class Circle extends Shape {
   }


Rectangle and Circle will take on the properties of Shape and then can be used to modify the 
properities of Shape.  The opposite direction does not work, Shape does not take on the properities 
of Rectangle or Circle.  Extending classes brings about the concept of the "Is-A" relationship.  In 
this example a Rectangle "is a" Shape and a Circle "is a" Shape but the opposite may not hold.  
For example a Shape does not have to be a Rectangle nor does a shape have to be a Cricle.


We can now override the property of area in both Cricle and Rectangle by implementing our 
own area calculations.


   public class Rectangle extends Shape {               public class Cirlcde extends Shape {

    private double len_;                                   private dobule radius_;
    private  double width_;

     public Rectangle( double l , double w ) {             public Cirlce( double r ) {
       len_=l; width_=w;                                       radius_=r;

     }                                                     }

    public double area() {                                 public double area() {
       return len_ *width_;                                    return Math.PI *radius_ * radius_;

    }                                                      }

     public double getLen() { return len_; }               public double getRadius() { return radius_; }
     public double getWidth() {return width_;}
   }                                                     }


we can also do this in our code:

   Shape aShape0= new Rectangle( 10,20);
   Shape aShape1 = new Circle(5);


because Rectangle and Circle are SubClasses / Derived from Shape, they are also Shapes.

if we call 

  aShape0.area() - this will  end up calling Rectangle's area()
   aShape1.area() - this will end up calling Cirlces area() 

because we created a Shape with the properities of a Rectangle in the first case and a 
Circle in the second case and overrode the method area.

We can do this because "area" is a method of Shape and in our implementation of Cricle 
we overrode the behavior.  "area" is a property of shape.

This ability to overide methods in Subclasses and them have them invoked as a 
Super class variable is called "ploymoprhism" .

Note we can't do this:

   aShape0.getWidth() ; NOT ALLOWED!!!!

while area is a property of Shape, getWidth is not that's for a Rectangle only the only way we can call 
this is to convert a Rectangle to a Shape


Casting a Shape back to a Rectangle we can get to the width.

   Rectangle aRectangle = (Rectangle)aShape0;

now on aRectangle we can do this

   aRectangle.getWidth();


Note if we try to cast a variable back to a different class than it was originally created we will 
get a java.lang.ClassCastException !!!


For example 

Cirlce aCricle = (Circle)aShape0; // This will throw an Exception !!!

This line will throw a java.lang.ClassCastException because Shape0 was 
created as a Rectangle not a Circle!
