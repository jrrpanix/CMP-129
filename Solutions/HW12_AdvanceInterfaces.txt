1) Give an example of code that creates a read-only text field ( Gaddis Chapter 13 : Question 1 (p 905) )

   JTextField f = new JTextField(10);
   f.setEditable(false);


 
2) Write code that creates a list with the fillowing items : Monday, Tuesday ... , Saturday, Sunday

   String [] days = { "Monday","Tuesday","Wednesday","Thrusday","Friday","Saturday","Sunday"};
   JList<String> slist = new JList<String>(days);

     or (if you are on verions of Java < 1.7 )

   JList<String> slist = new JList<String>(days);
   JScrollPane scroll = new JScrollPane(slist);



12) Write code that creates a JSlider component. The component should be horizontally oriented
    and it's range should be 0 to 1000. Display labels and tick marks.  Major ticks every 100th
    number , minor ticks every 25th.  Initial value of slider at 500.


    JSlider slide = new JSlider(JSlider.HORIZONTAL,0,1000,500);
    slide.setMajorTickSpacing(100);
    slide.setMinorTickSpacing(25);
