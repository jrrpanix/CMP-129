Chapter 8 , Pg. 554, Problem 2 (a,b,c,d,e)

Consider the following class declaration:

   public class Thing {
     private int x;
     private int y;
     private static int z=10;
   
     public Thing() {
       x=z;
       y=z;
     }
   
     static void putThing(int a ) {
       z=a;
     }
   }

Assume aprogram containing the class defins three Thing objects with
the following statements:

   Thing one = new Thing();
   Thing two = new Thing();
   Thing three = new Thing();
   
a. How many separate instances of the x member exist ?

   answer : 3 ( one.x,two.x,three.x)

b. How many separate instances of the y member exist ?

   answer : 3 ( one.y,two.y,three.y)

c. How many separate instances of the z member exist ?

   answer : 1 ( Thing.z , z is static so by definition only 1 exists!)

d. What value will be stored in the x and y members of each object?

   answer: the current value of z, which in the above code example is 10

e. Write a statement that will call the putThing method.

   answer: Thing.putThing(100);
