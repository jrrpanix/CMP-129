Chapter 8 questions from "Java From Control Structures Through Objects" 5th Edition, Tony Gaddis
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) The type of method that cannnot access any non-static member variables in its own class.

    Answer: c  : static methods can't access non-static members 

    Example

    public class A {

       public int x_;  // <- this an "instance member" (aka non-static)
       public static int Z; // <- this is a static member

       public static void aStaticFunction() {
          int a = x_; <- THIS IS ILLEGAL. NOT ALLOWED!!!  x_ can't be accessed here because its a static method!!!
	  Z++; <- OK! static functions can access static member variables!!!
       }
    }

(2) When an object is passed as an argument to a method, this is actually passed.

    Answer: c: a reference to the object 

    all objects are passed as references in Java, primitives are passed by copy

(3) If you write this method for a class, Java will automatically call it any time you concatenate
    an object with the class of a string

    Answer a: toString

    Example

    public class A {

       public String toString() {
         return new String(":A");
       }

       public static void main( String [] args ) {
         A a = new A();
	 System.out.println( "We are printing class " + a );  <- Example of concatenation
                                                              <- when "a" is concatenated with a String
							      <- it calls the method toString() 
       }
    }
    The output of this call will be   
    
    We are printing class :A

(4) Making an instance of one class field in another class is called ?

    Answer: c : aggregation

    public class Book {
       public String title;
       public String author;
    }
    
    public class Instructor {
      public String lastName;
      public String firstName;
      public String department;
    }

    public class Course {
      public Instructor instructor;    <- Example of Aggregation Instructor instance is in class Cource
      public Book       textBook;      <- Example of Aggregatoin Book instance is in class Course
      public String     courseSection;
      public String     courseTitle;
    }

(5) The name of a reference variable that is always avaialble to an instance method
    and refers to the object that is calling the method

    Answer : b : this

    public class A {
      public int a;

      public A( int a ) {
        this.a_ = a;  <- "this" is always available in instance methods
      } 
    }

(6) This enum method returns the position of an enum constant in a declaration
    Answer: c: ordinal

    enum Seasons { SPRING, WINTER, SUMMER , FALL };

    Seasons aSeason = Seasons.Winter;
    aSeason.ordinal() == 1;

(7) Assuming the following declaration exists:
    enum Seasons { SPRING, WINTER, SUMMER , FALL };
    what is the fully qualified name of the Fall constant ?
    
    Answer: d : Seasons.FALL    

(8) You cannot use the fully qualified of an enum constant for this.

    Answer: b : a case expression

    Example:

    enum Seasons { SPRING, WINTER, SUMMER , FALL };	

    public static double GetTemp( Seasons aSeason ) {

        switch( aSeason ) {
	  case Seasons.SPRING: return 55;  <- Not Allowed! case CAN'T have full qualfied name Seasons.SPRING!!!!
	  case WINTER: return 20;          <- OK, in the case statement WINTER !
	  case SUMMER: return 85;          <- OK, in the case statement SUMMER ! 
	  case FALL:   return 45;          <- OK, in the case statement FALL !
	  default:
	  break;
	}
	return 0;
    } 
    
(9) The Java Virtual Machine periodically performs this process, which automatically removes unreferenced
    objects from memory

    Answer: c: garbage collection

(10) If a class this method is called automatically before an instance of the class is destoryed by the JVM

     Answer: a: finalize

(11) CRC stands for :

     Answer: b : Class Responsiblities Collaborations

(12) True or False : A static method may refer to non-satic members variables of the same class,
     but only after an instance of the class has been defined.

     Answer: False  

     (Note the wording of the question lends to ambiguity) 

     The instance variables in a static method may refer to non-static members but not the method itself
     (its not entirely clear from the question)

     For example :

     class A {
        public int x ;
     
        public satic void HelloA() {
	  A anInstance = new A();
	  System.out.println( anInstance.x ); // OK! 
	  System.out.println( x ) ; // NOT OK!!! an instance of A is required to refer to x 
	}
     }

(13) True or False : All static member variables are initalized to -1 by defult

     Answer: False : they are initalized to 0 by default

     class A {
       public static int X;  <- this will be initalized to zero
     }

     


(14) True or False : When an object is passed as an argument to a method, the
     method can acess the argument

     Answer: True : why else would you pass it as an argument

     public void someMethod( String aString ) {
        long hash = aString.hashCode(); <- Perfectly OK! Object accessing a method 
     }


(15) True or False : A method cannot return a reference to an object

     Anwser: False : of course it can


     public String yourName() {
        return new String("John"); <- Perfectly OK! Returning a reference to an object
     }

(16) True or False : You can declare an enumerated type inside a method.
     
     Answer False : enum types can't be local


     Example output from javac (java compilier showing that local enum is not allowed)

     public class A {

     public static void DemoLocalEnumFail() {
	enum LocalE { X , Y , Z };   <----- NOT ALLOWED!!!!!
	LocalE e = LocalE.X;
	System.out.println(e);
    }
    }

    javac A.java 
	
    A.java:4: error: enum types must not be local
	enum LocalE { X , Y , Z };
	^
	1 error



(17) True or False : Enumerated types are actually special types of classes.

     Answer True : they are derived from object and come with a number of build in methods


(18) True or False : Enum constants have a toString() method.

     Answer True : Seasons.FALL.toString() <- toString is build in!

From Gaddis Chapter 8, Algorithm Workbench
---------------------------------------------

Chapter 8 , Pg. 554, Problem 2 (a,b,c,d,e)

Consider the following class declaration:

   public class Thing {
     private int x;
     private int y;
     private static int z=10;
   
     public Thing() {
       x=z;
       y=z;
     }
   
     static void putThing(int a ) {
       z=a;
     }
   }

Assume aprogram containing the class defins three Thing objects with
the following statements:

   Thing one = new Thing();
   Thing two = new Thing();
   Thing three = new Thing();
   
a. How many separate instances of the x member exist ?

   answer : 3 ( one.x,two.x,three.x)

b. How many separate instances of the y member exist ?

   answer : 3 ( one.y,two.y,three.y)

c. How many separate instances of the z member exist ?

   answer : 1 ( Thing.z , z is static so by definition only 1 exists!)

d. What value will be stored in the x and y members of each object?

   answer: the current value of z, which in the above code example is 10

e. Write a statement that will call the putThing method.

   answer: Thing.putThing(100);

3. Carpet Calculator

The Westfield Carpet Company has asked you to write an application that calculates the
price of carpeting for rectangular rooms.  To calculate the price, you multiply the area of the
floor( width x length) by the price per square foot of the carpet.  

First create a class called RoomDimension that has two fields, one for the length 
and one for the width.  The RoomDimension class should have a method that 
returns the area of the room.

Next create a class called RoomCarpet that has RooomDimension as a field. It should also have
a field for the cost of the carpet per square foot.  The RoomCarpet class should have method
that returns the total cost of the carpet.

answer:

public class RoomDimension {
   private double width;
   private double length;

   public RoomDimension( double w , double l ) {
      this.width = w;
      this.length = l;
   }

   public double getArea() {
      return length*width;
   }

   public String toString() {
     return new String( "RoomDimension:width=" + width + ":length=" +length );
   }
}


public class RoomCarpet {

    private RoomDimension roomDim;
    private double        costPerSqFt;


    public RoomCarpet( RoomDimension dim , double costsqft ) {
       roomDim = dim;
       costPeSqFt =costsqft;
    }


    public double getTotalCost() {
       return roomDim.getArea() * costPerSqFt;
    }


    public String toString() {
       return new String( "RoomCarpet:" + roomDim +":costPerSqFt=" + costPerSqFt );
    }
}
