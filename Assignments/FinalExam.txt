CMP-129 Final Exam
May 7th 8:00 am


1) Answer the following 3 questions 

	a) create an array of int called X, that's initialized with 1,2,3,4


	b) create an array of int called X, that's size 5


	c) for the array declaration int [] X = {5,12,3,1};

	    What is X[0] ?

	    What is X[3] ? 


2) What is the value of "total" after the following code sequence is executed

   int [] X = { 1, 2 ,3 };
   int [] Y = { 2, 1, 1 };

   int total = 0;
   for( int i = 0; i < X.length ; i++ ) 
      total += X[i]*Y[1];

3) What are the values of "sum" , X[1][1] and Z[0][2] , after the following code sequence is executed?

        int [][] X = { {1,2} , {3,6} , {4,5} };        
        int [][] Z = { {1,2,3} , {1,3 ,7} };
        X[1][1] += X[0][0];       
        Z[0][2] += Z[1][2];        
        int sum = X[1][1] + Z[0][2];

	a) sum =  ?
	b) X[1][1] = ?
	c) Z[0][2] = ? 


4)  Write a static function to "findString" to find the index of the first occurrence of a String variable   
    called "pattern" in an String array, String [] Z, have it return -1 if it does not find the variable,   
    make the search case insensitive, so the findString treats "ABC" and "abc" exactly the same.

    static public int findString( String [] Z , String pattern ) {
    }



5) Override the toString method for the following class Point, have it return the variables in the
   class separated by a ":".

   public class Point {
      public int X;
      public int Y;
   }

6) Overload the equals method for the calss Point , have it return true if the X and Y variables
   are the same for the 2 points.

   public class Point {
      public int X;
      public int Y;
   }



7) correct the compile error in the code below by writing code that
   will handle the exception in the method below

   public void printFile( String fileName ) {
       File f = new File( fileName );
       Scanner scan = new Scanner(f);
       while(scan.hasNextLine() ) {
          System.out.print( scan.nextLine() );
       }
   }

    

8)  What is the output if main is executed?

    public class ExceptionTest    {       
         public static void main( String []  args ) {
               try {             
                        System.out.println("A");
                        System.out.println( Integer.parseInt( "11" ) );
                        System.out.println( Double.parseDouble( "XYZ" ) );
                        System.out.println("B");          
                  }   catch( NumberFormatException e ) { 
                        System.out.println("C");          
                  }   catch( Exception e ) {              
                        System.out.println("D");         
                  }   finally {              
                       System.out.println("E");         
                  }         
                  System.out.println("F");      
                 }   
            }


9) Create a class call "SimpleFrame" which extends from
   JFrame, has width 200 , height 500 , is at location 200,300
   and the defult close operation is to exit Make it visible after
   its constructed.  Give it the title "Final Exam" .
   Be sure to import the correct packages.



10) Use a BorderLayout and place the following 5 buttons at the position
    in the layout corresponding to their name, so for Example the button 
    named Top should go at the top of the layout.


    private void initLayout() {

       JPanel panel = new JPanel();
       panel.setLayout( new BorderLayout() );
       JButton topB = new JButton("Top");
       JButton leftB = new JButton("Left");
       JButton rightB = new JButton("Right");
       JButton bottomB = new JButton("Bottom");
       JButton centerB = new JButton("Center");

       
       // write the code here the place the buttons in the position
       // corresponding to their name .

       ---> ADD CODE HERE .....

       add(panel);
    }



11) Implement the correct listener interface for a JButton so that 
    when the button below is press it print "Button Pressed". Name
    name the implementation "ButtonListener"

    
    private JButton aButton;

    private void initButton() {
       aButton = new JButton("Press");
       aButton.addActionListener( new ButtonListener()) :
    }

    // Fill in the rest of the code 
    private class ButtonListener

14) Implement the interface KeyListener for the following text
    fields so that when the key is released it grabs the text in
    the fields , adds them together and displays the result in
    the field called "result"

    private JTextField x1Field;
    private JTextField x2Field;
    private JTextField result;

    void initTextFields() {

        x1Field = new JTextField(15);

	result.setEditable(false);
        x1Field.addKeyListener(new TextKeyListener());
        x2Field.addKeyListener(new TextKeyListener());
    }

   // Implement Here so that when when a Key is Released
   // the contents of x1Field and x2Field are added togehter
   // and the sum is displayed in JTextField "result"
   class TextKeyListener implements KeyListener{


   }

18) Write the declaration for a class "B" . The class members should be as follows:

    m an integer.  This variable should not be accessible to code outside of
    the class or any class that extends from B,

    n an integer.  This variable should only be accessible to any variable that 
    extends from B or is in the same package as class B.

    write getM , getN accessor and mutator methods that are accsssible
