Random Character Builder
---------------------------------

(50 pts) We are going to create a random character string of parameter size where the possible range of characters is 
input to the funciton call from a [char start, char end].  For example fi we want to generate a character string where 
the characters are between 'A' and 'E', these would be the starting chacters.  We can use the 
Random.nextInt() routine to help generate, by casting the char to int and then back to char.

static public String RandomString( int len, char begin , char end ){

}
