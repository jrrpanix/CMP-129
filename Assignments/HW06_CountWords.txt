In Class Assignment - Reading Files and Counting Words
--------------------------------------------------------------

The purpose of this exercise is to check your skills in opening and reading files.  A big part of 
software development is getting data (either from files, databases, user input, the web or other types of servers).  
For this exercise your ability to read data from existing files will be checked.  If you review the code samples 
in GitHub or read Chapter 4 of your text you will have enough information to do this exercise.

 

You will need to remember the following things:

import statements (java.io.File,java.io.FileNotFoundException,java.util.Scanner)
the .File. class
the .Scanner. class
putting a try/catch around Scanner when you create it
some member functions of Scanner (hasNext(), hasNextLine(),next(),nextLine())
 

Task1 (10 points) Create a Java Class in project .Lecture4. named .ReadFile..

 

Task2 (40 points) Create a static function called .countWords. and write the code for which returns the number of words scanned 
(determined by next()) and takes as an argument the file name.  The code will open the file and scan through the file keeping 
track of the number of words it reads.

 

The function signature should look like this

public static long countWords( String fileName )

Task3 (40 points) After you write the function "countWords" in the Java file ReadFile , you will need to test that it works.  
Using any text editor (or Microsoft word) create a file called TestFileA2.txt and put in the file the following line :

                            This file has five words.

Then in the "ReadFile.java" class  add a public static void main( String args[] ) and call your function countWords , 
use args[0] to input the name and location of TestFileA2.txt that you created and print out the number of words in the file.

Once this test is sucessful (it should have counted five words) you will then run your program on the 
SOU.txt file found in GitHub and report the number of words in that file.  It should be several thousand words.
