The purpose of this assignment which is due by the end of class today is provide a check point on 
where you are in acquiring the basic skills to develop software in java. The questions will get progressively 
more challenging.   Please follow the instructions exactly.  Follow the project names, class names and function 
names that are given.   It is my hope that everyone is the class can complete this assignment today.  If you can.t 
complete this assignment by end of class today, then you will need to spend time with me outside of class so you 
can get to that point that this is easy.  At the end of the class you will submit the code that you have written 
and the output this code produced.

 

(80 points Total)

 

 

Task 1 (10 points) Start up the Java IDE, Eclipse

 

Task 2 (10 points) Create a Java Project and name it .Lecture4.

 

Task 3 (10 points) Create a Java Class under Project .Lecture4. and name it .MyName..  
When creating the check the appropriate box to create a .static void main..

 

Task 4 (10 points) Once this class is created add code to .main. to print your name using the statement:

                Hello, my name is [YOUR NAME HERE]

                For example if your name is .John: then the output will be

                this is some sample input

 

Task 6 (10 points) Create a static void function called .printArgs. that takes a String [] as a function argument and 
prints the contents of the array, with each element of the array printed on a separate line.

 

Task 7 (10 points) Call the function printArgs from main passing the parameter .args. to print args.  
This function call in main will be below(after) the line where you printed your name.

 

Task 8 (10 points) Using java.util.Arrays , add code to .main. that sorts the args array and then calls the function printArgs  
which was created in task 7.
