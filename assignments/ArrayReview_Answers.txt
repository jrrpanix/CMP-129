10 pts , 2 pts each

1) Write code for the following questions 

   a) Initialize and array of int , called A, with the values 1 to 5, using {} .

Answer:   int [] A = { 1 , 2, 3, 4 ,5 };


   b) what is the value of A[1] ?

Answer:     The value of A[1] = 2

   c) Create an array of int which can hold 1000 numbers and initialize it with the values 0 to 999.

Answer:

     int [] A = new int[1000];
     for ( int i =0; i < A.length; i++) A[i] = i;

2) Write the code to sum the contents of an int array .

Answer:

	public static long sum( int [] A ) {
	    long t =0;
	    for( int i =0; i < A.length ; i++ ) t += A[i];
	    return t;
	}


3) Write the code to find a String X in an array of String and return its position of found otherwise return -1.

Answer:
    public static int find( String X , String [] V ) {

      for( int i =0; i < V.length ; i++ )
         if (X.equals(V[i]) return i;
      return -1;
    }


4) Is the following ok or not ok? If its not ok tell why.

   a) int [] X = {1,2};
      X[2] = 3;

Answer: not ok, array length is 2 index 2 is out of bounds, max index is 1

   b) int [] X = {1,2,3};
      X[-1] = 6;

Answer: not ok, negative indicies not allowed in Java , ok in python

   c) int [] X = new int[1000];

Answer , ok

   d) String [] X = new String[10];
    
      String Y = X[0] + "ABC";

Answer , ok but terrible programming X[0] is null ... 

5) What is the contents of X after the following code sequence ?

   int [] X = new int[2];

   for( int i =0; i < X.length ;i++ ) 
       X[i]=i;

    int [] Y = X;

    Y[0] += 2;


Answer : Y[0] =2
