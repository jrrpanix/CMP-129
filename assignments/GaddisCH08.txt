The Westfield Carpet Company has asked you to write an application that calculates the
price of carpeting for rectangular rooms.  To calculate the price, you multiply the area of the
floor( width x length) by the price per square foot of the carpet.  

First create a class called RoomDimension that has two fields, one for the length 
and one for the width.  The RoomDimension class should have a method that 
returns the area of the room.

Next create a class called RoomCarpet that has RooomDimension as a field. It should also have
a field for the cost of the carpet per square foot.  The RoomCarpet class should have method
that returns the total cost of the carpet.
