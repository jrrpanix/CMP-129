-------------------------------------

(1) (3 pts) What is the length of the Array X in the code below ?

    int [] X = {1,2,3,4};


(2) (3 pts) What is the value of X[2] in the code below ?

    int [] X = {1,2,3,4};


(3) (3 pts) Complete the code to return the last element in the array:
   
    public static int getLast( int [] X ) {      
     // what code needs to be written here to return the last element?

    }


(4) (3 pts) Complete the code to return the first element in the array:

    public static int getFirst( int [] X ) {       
       // Write code below to return the first element in the Array X

(5) (3 pts) What's the value of Z[4] after the following code sequence is executed?
        
     int [] Z = {2,4,6,8,10};        
     Z[4]--;        
     Z[4] += Z[1];


(6) (3 pts) Write a function "find" which returns the position of a String pattern in a String array X .
             If the pattern is not found it returns -1;

    public static int find( String pattern , String [] X ) {

      variables X and Y that are int.


(12) (3 pts) For the class Point you created in the previous question, implement the 
     default constructor.


(13) (3 pts) For the class Point , implement a constructor that takes two integers as agruments
