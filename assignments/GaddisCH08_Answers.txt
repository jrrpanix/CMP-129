Consider the following class declaration:

   public class Thing {
     private int x;
     private int y;
     private static int z=10;
   
     public Thing() {
       x=z;
       y=z;
     }
   
     static void putThing(int a ) {
       z=a;
     }
   }

Assume a program containing the class defins three Thing objects with
the following statements:

   Thing one = new Thing();
   Thing two = new Thing();
   Thing three = new Thing();


a. How many separate instances of the x member exist ?
b. How many separate instances of the y member exist ?
c. How many separate instances of the z member exist ?
d. What value will be stored in the x and y members of each object?
e. Write a statement that will call the putThing method.


Answers:

a) 3 instances of "x" in varaibles one,two,three

b) 3 instances of "y" in varaibles one,two,three

c) 1 instance of "z" because its static

d) x an y will be initalized with the value of z which is 10

e) Thing.putThing(11);

The Westfield Carpet Company has asked you to write an application that calculates the
price of carpeting for rectangular rooms.  To calculate the price, you multiply the area of the
floor( width x length) by the price per square foot of the carpet.  

First create a class called RoomDimension that has two fields, one for the length 
and one for the width.  The RoomDimension class should have a method that 
returns the area of the room.

Next create a class called RoomCarpet that has RooomDimension as a field. It should also have
a field for the cost of the carpet per square foot.  The RoomCarpet class should have method
that returns the total cost of the carpet.


Answers:


public class RoomDimenstion {

    private double _length;
    private double _width;

    public RoomDimension( double l , double w ) {

        _length=l;
    	_width=w;
    }

    public double area() {
      return _length * _width;
    }


}


public class RoomCarpet (
     private RoomDimension _room;
     private double        _costPerSquareFoot;

     public RoomCarpet( RoomDimension room ,double costPerSquareFoot; ) {
        _room=room;
        _costPerSquareFoot=costPerSquareFoot;
     }

     public double totalCost() {
        return _room.area() * _costPerSquareFoot;
     }
       
}
