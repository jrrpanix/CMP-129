// Title       : Graphics
// Instructor  : JReynolds


Based on material covered in Chapter 14, section 14.5  of Gaddis

In the lecture we are going to cover the basics of using the Graphics Object in Java


   *) Each Object that inherits from Component has an internal object that inherits 
      from Graphics class
   *) Components have a method called "void paint(Graphics )" which allows the component
      to update the graphics object
   *) The Graphics class has an XY Coordinate System in Pixels where
      * (0,0) is the top left corner 
      * (0,HEIGHT) is the bottom left corner
      * (WIDTH,0) is the top right corner
      * (WIDTH,HEIGHT) is teh bottom right corner

      
    (0,0)               (WITDH,0)

      |                   |
      |                   |
      |                   |
      |                   |

    (0,HEIGHT)          (WIDTH,HEIGHT)


Example (1) Drawing a Simple Rectangle on a Canvas (note we are making a class that extends from
            JPanel not JFrame, so its more direct to draw to)


	import java.awt.*;
	import java.swing.*;

	public class GraphEx extends JPanel {
	
	    public GraphEx() {
	    }

	    // draw a green rectangle
	    public void paint(Graphics g ) {
	       super.paint(g);
	       g.setColor(Color.green);
	       // draw a rectangle starting in the top left corner
	       // that is 50 pixels wide and 50 pixels high
	       g.drawRectangle(0,0,50,50); 
	    }

	    static public void RunEx() {
	       JFrame frame = new JFrame();
	       frame.setSize(400,400);
	       frame.setLocation(200,200);
	       frame.add( new GraphEx());
	       frame.setVisible(true);
	    }


	    public static void main( String [] args ) {
	       RunEx();
	    }

	}
