Part I: A Second Look at Classes and Objects
(Covers Gaddis Ch 8, pre-requsite Gaddis Ch6)
--------------------------------------------------------------

Concepts:
* instance
* keywords: new,static,public,private,this
* constructors: default, copy constructor, class specific
* passing to and retruning Objects from methods
* overriding methods from Object
* enums
* class destruction - Gargage Collection, finanize
* aggregation
--------------------------------------------------------------

(1) For the following class 

    public class Point {
       public int x;
       public int y;
       public static int z;

     public Point() {
         x=0;
	 y=0;
	 z++;
       }

     public Point( int x , int y ) {
        this.x=x;
	this.y=y
	z++;
     }
       
     public static void setZ(int p ) {
        z=p;
     }

     public static void main(String [] args ){
        new Point();
	new Point();
	new Point();
     }

    }


   (a) create an instance of Point calling the default constructor

   (b) create an instance of Point with x=11,y=3

   (c) write the code to call setZ with p=100

   (d) if main is called in the above code:

         (i)   How many instances of z are there?

	 (ii)  What is(are) the value(s) of z?

	 (iii) How many instances of x are there?

	 (iv)  What is(are) the value(s) of x?

   (e) implement the copy constructor    


(2) What's the difference between a class and an instance of a class ? (from Gaddis Ch 6 p399)
    

(2b) True of False. An instance of a class is also called an Object ?


(2c) What value does Java automatically store in uninitialized static variables ?


(3) What's the purpose of the keyword "new" ? (from Gaddis Ch 6 p399)
    


(4) Wite a class called Item which holds 3 fields 
    1) description 
    2) units on hand 
    3) price
    
    the class should contain a default constructor and a constructor which
    sets the three fields. 
    
    override the toString() method creating a string which lists the 3 values of the field
    
    override the equals(Object) method 
    
    overload the equals method by creating one which takes Item as an argument


(5) For the following class below identify what's wrong with the code or is it correct?

    public class AProblem {
       public int x;

       public int increase() {
         x++;
       }

       static public void assignX( int p ) {
          x=p;
       }

    }


(6) enum Color { Red , Yellow, Blue , Green };

 
    a)  write the code to assign a variable of type Color to Blue

    b) what's the output of 

       System.out.println(Color.Green.ordinal());

   c) What's the output of 

       System.out.println(Color.Blue.toString());


(7) list at least 4 methods that a class inherits from Java SuperClass Object.


(8) What's wrong with the following code or is it correct?

    class AnotherProblmem {
    
       private int x;

       public int AnotherProblem() {
          x=5;
	  return x;
       }

    }

    
(9) The name of a reference variable that's always available to an instance method ?


(10) What's wrong with the following code, or is it all correct ?

     public class Fruit {
        private String name_;

        public void setName( String name ) {
	   name_=name;
	}
	
	public static void print( Fruit f ) {	
	  System.out.println(f);
	}

	public static void main( String [] args ) {
	  Fruit.setName("Banana");
	}
     }


(11) What's the output if main is called in the following code ?

     public class Circle {    
         private double r_;

	 public Circle( double r ) {
	   r_=r;
	 }     

	 public String toString() {
	   return new String("Circle:r_="+r_);
	 }
	 
	 public static void main( String [] args ) {
	    System.out.println( new Circle(4));
	 }
     }


(12)  What is Garbage Collection ?


(12b) If an object has this method what does the JVM call right before an instance 
      of the class is destroyed?


(13) What's the value of X in the following code sequence if main is called from ItemCalc ?

     public class Item {
        public int X;

	public Item( int a ) {
	   X=a;
	}
     }

     public class ItemCalc {
         
       public static void addItem( Item anItem ) {
          anItem.X += 1;
       }               

       public static void main( String [] args ) {
           Item anItem = new Item(10);
	   addItem(anItem);
       }

     }


(14) What's wrong the the following code or is it correct?

     public class Item {
        private int X;

	public Item( int a ) {
	   X=a;
	}
     }

     public class ItemCalc {
         
       public static void addItem( Item anItem ) {
          anItem.X += 1;
       }               

     }


(15) Given the following code fill in the rest of code for 
     the call to the constructor RoomCleaner in main
     assuming the Room Dimensions are length=10, width=20
     and the costPerSqFt = 1.25
     
     public class Room {
        public double len;	
	public double width;

	public Room( double l, double w ) {
	  len=l;
	  width=w;
	}

	public double area() {
	  return len*width;
	}

     }

     public class RoomCleaner {
         public Room    aRoom;
	 public double  costPerSqFt;
        
	 public RoomCleaner( Room r, double cost ) {
	   aRoom=r:
	   costPerSqFt=cost;
	 }

	 public double totalCost() {
	   return aRoom.area() * costPerSqFt;
	 }

	 public static void main( String [] args ){
	    RoomCleaner roomC = new RoomCleaner   <- Complete the code here so the call to RoomCleaner is correct!
	 }
     }
