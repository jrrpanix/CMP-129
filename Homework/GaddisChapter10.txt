(1) In an inheritance relationship this is the general class 

Answer:  b  : superclass

(2) In an inheritance relationship this is the specialized class 

Answer: c : subclass

(3) This keyword indicates that a class inherits from another class 

Answer: d : extends

(4) A subclass does not have access to these superclass members 

Answer: b : private 

(5) This keyword refers to an objects superclass

Answer: a : super

(6) In a subclass constructor, a call to the superclas constructor must _______

Answer: a : appear as the very first statement

(7) The following is an explicit call to a superclass's default constructor :

Answer: c : super();

(8) A method in a subclass that has the same signature as a method in the super class
    is an example of ____

Answer: b : overriding

(9) A method in a subclass that has the same name but differet signature as a 
    method in the super class is an example of ____

Answer: a : overloading

(10) These superclass members are accessible to subclasses and classes in the same package

Answer: c : protected

(note classes in the same package can access public and protected members, but subclasses can
 access both public and protected inside or outside of the class, regardless of package.  
 Classes outside of the package can't access protected members unless they are a subclass).

(11) All classes directly or indirectly inherit from this class.

Answer: a : Object

(12) With this type of binding, the JVM determines at runtime which method to call,
     depending on the type of object that a variable references 

Answer: d : dynamic

(13) This operator can be used to determine wether a reference variable references
     an of a particular class.

Answer: c : instanceof

(14) When a class implements and interface, it must _____

Answer: b : provide all methods that are listed in the interface, with the exact signatures 
            and return types specified

(15) Fields in an interface are 

Answer: c : both final and static


(16) Abstract methods must be 

Answer: a : overridden

(17) Abstract classes cannot be 

Answer: c : instantiated

(18) True or False: Constructors are not inherited.

Answer: True

(Each subclass must define its own constuctors but can call super class constructors)

(19) True or False: In a subclass, a call to a superclass constructor can only be
     written in a the subclass constructor

Answer: True

(20) True or False: If a subclass constructor does not explicitly call any superclass
     constructors Java will not call any of the superclass constructors

Answer: False

(the default constructor of the superclass is called if no explicit call is made to
 a superclass constructor)

(21) True or False: An object of the superclass can access members declared in the subclass

Answer: False

(22) The superclass constructor always executes before the subclass constructor

Answer: True

(23) True or False: When a method is declared final it must be overridden in a subclass

Answer: False

(24) Ture or False: A superclass has a member with package access.  A class that is outisde
the superclass's package but inherits from the superclass can access the members.

Answer: True

(25) True or False: A superclass reference variable can reference an object of a superclass
that extends the superclass

Answer: True

(Object the ultimate super class, can be a reference to any class )

(26) True or False: A supclass reference variable can reference an object of the superclass

Answer: False

(27) True or False: When a class contains an abstract method it can't be instantiated

Answer: True

(28) True or False: A class can only implement one interfce

Answer: False

(29) By default all members of an interface are public

Answer: True
